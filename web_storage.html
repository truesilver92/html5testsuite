    <h1>HTML5 Web Storage</h1>

    <h4>This is stuff that may be stored on the local computer by the web page<</h4>
										   <h4>localStorage and sessionStorage</h4>

										   <p>localStorage - has no expiration date</p>

										   <p>sessionStorage - stores data for one session</p>

										   <h4>localStorage example</h4>

										   <div id="result"></div>
										   <script>
										     if(typeof(Storage)!=="undefined")
										     {
										     localStorage.lastname="Smith";
										     document.getElementById("result")innerHTML="Last name: " + localStorage.lastname;
										     }
										     else
										     {
										     document.getElementById("result").innerHTML="Sorry, your browser does not support web storage...";
										     }
										   </script>

										   <h4>There seems to be a problem with a lot of the examples. It may be that my browser is not updated enough. It also may mean that this site does not have good examples</h4>
