The point of this project is for me to learn html5 while creating this test suite. So it may not function very well as a test system yet. I do not think I will make it into a full out test suite because I have no incentive to do so.

If you would like to help make it a full test suite just contact me and we can work together on it.

To "run" this system open home.html and follow links.
